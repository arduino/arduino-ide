This repository contains the source code of the Arduino IDE 2.x. If you're looking for the old IDE, go to the [repository of the 1.x version](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino).

The Arduino IDE 2.x is a major rewrite, sharing no code with the IDE 1.x. It is based on the [Theia IDE](https://theia-ide.org/) framework and built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). The backend operations such as compilation and uploading are offloaded to an [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) instance running in daemon mode. This new IDE was developed with the goal of preserving the same interface and user experience of the previous major version in order to provide a frictionless upgrade.
